# freshfarmpicking-react

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open localhost:port to view it in the browser.

### Components need to be imported to src/pages/Home.tsx file. We only need to change the file name suffix to tsx, and the rest is the same as writing jsx in react.
